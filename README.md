# Basic PHP MVC Project with Bootstrap

This project is a beginner-level practice in PHP, using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern and **Bootstrap** for styling. It was created as a learning exercise to understand the basics of MVC architecture and frontend styling.

## Features
- **MVC Structure**: Separates code into models, views, and controllers.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Basic styling for responsive and modern UI components.
- **Simple CRUD**: Basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality (if applicable).

## Technologies Used
- **PHP**: Backend logic and MVC implementation.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive styling for the frontend.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic markup and styling.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure PHP is installed on your system.
3. Place the project in your web server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
4. Start the server and access the project through `http://localhost/your_project_folder`.

## Usage
- Explore the code in the `models`, `views`, and `controllers` folders to see the MVC pattern in action.
- Customize or extend the project to deepen your understanding of PHP and Bootstrap.

## Notes
This is a basic, beginner project and may lack advanced error handling or optimizations. It serves as a foundation to build more complex PHP applications in the future.
